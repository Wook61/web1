<p>“anti-democratic,” and a violation of the due process clause of the Constitution. “There is no way I resign.”
<p>The governor’s statements on Sunday afternoon</P> <P>came not long after Ms. Stewart-Cousins had informed</P>
<p>Mr. Cuomo in a phone call that she was about to</P> call for him to step down, according to a person with
<p> knowledge of the conversation; the governor then</P> quickly convened his own news conference to pre-empt her announcement.
<p>He told reporters that his remarks were directed at </P>“some legislators who suggest that I resign.”
<p>Undeterred, Ms. Stewart-Cousins fired back, releasing </P>her statement not long after Mr. Cuomo concluded his news conference.
